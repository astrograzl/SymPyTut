\noindent
The exponential function $f(x)=e^x$ is special because it is equal to its derivative:

\small
\begin{verbatimtab}
>>> diff( exp(x), x)     # same as diff( E**x, x)
exp(x)                   # same as E**x
\end{verbatimtab}
\normalsize

\noindent
A differential equation is an equation that relates some unknown function $f(x)$ to its derivative. 
An example of a differential equation is $f'(x)=f(x)$.
What is the function $f(x)$ which is equal to its derivative?
You can either try to guess what $f(x)$ is or use the \texttt{dsolve} function:

\small
\begin{verbatimtab}
>>> x = symbols('x')
>>> f = symbols('f', cls=Function)        # can now use f(x)
>>> dsolve( f(x) - diff(f(x),x), f(x) )
f(x) == C1*exp(x)
\end{verbatimtab}
\normalsize

\noindent
We'll discuss \texttt{dsolve} again in the section on mechanics.
